# Parameter Scan of denudation 

Denudation consists of 3 different modes: chemical dissolution, physical erosion and empirical estimation. All parameters should be scanned with a reasonable range. Given that these parameters are poorly constrained, a uniform distribution is suited in this scenario.

## Parameters in chemical dissolution
There are two groups of parameters should be tested:
### Group 1: lithological control (i.e., related to facies)
- mass density
- infiltration co-efficient
- reactive surface of carbonate rocks

In the design we have to first set all three facies having the same parameters. 

The range of density is set between 

### Group 2: ambient environmental control (e.g., annual climate)
- precipitation
- atmospheric carbon dioxide level
- temperature
- reaction rate
